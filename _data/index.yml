      To get yourself added to our Jenkins instance, you will need to join our Discord Server and apply with an open source project.<br> 
      We will review your project and approve it, if it follows basic guidelines. You can read more about them in Documentation.

      CodeMC was originally created by a group of developers who wanted to provide a free Jenkins instance to the public.<br>
      However, the organization would not be possible without our wonderful volunteers that give their time to help maintain the project.<br>
